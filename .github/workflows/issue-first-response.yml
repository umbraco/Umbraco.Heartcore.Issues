            Hi there @${{ github.actor }}!

            Firstly, a big thank you for raising this issue. Every piece of feedback we receive helps us to make Heartcore better.

            We really appreciate your patience while we wait for our team to have a look at this but we wanted to let you know that we see this and share with you the plan for what comes next.
              * We'll replicate the issue to ensure that the problem is as described.
              * We'll decide whether the behavior is an issue or if the behavior is intended.
              * If we need any further information, we'll reach out with any questions.

            We wish we could work with everyone directly and assess your issue immediately but we're in the fortunate position of having lots of feedback to work with and only a few humans who are able to do anything with it. We are making progress though, and we'll keep you posted when we have something to report!

            Thanks, from your friendly Umbraco GitHub bot ðŸ¤– ðŸ™‚
